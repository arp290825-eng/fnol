Dear Claims Team,

I need to report a slip and fall incident that occurred at my restaurant today. My business policy number is CL789012345.

Business Information:
- Tony's Italian Bistro
- 890 Main Street, Springfield, IL 62701
- Business License: BL-2024-5567
- Owner: Antonio Martinez

Incident Details:
Date: March 20, 2024
Time: Approximately 1:45 PM
Location: Dining room area, near the kitchen entrance

What happened:
A customer, Ms. Jennifer Walsh (DOB: 09/14/1981), slipped and fell while walking to her table. She was following the hostess to a booth when she slipped on what appeared to be a small amount of water on the floor near the kitchen service area.

The customer fell backwards and hit her head on the corner of an adjacent table. She was conscious but complained of head pain and back pain. We immediately called 911, and she was transported to Springfield General Hospital by ambulance.

Witnesses:
1. Maria Santos (hostess) - saw the fall happen
2. Customer at Table 12 - David Kim (gave us his contact info)
3. Kitchen staff member - Carlos Rodriguez

I've attached:
- Photos of the scene taken immediately after the incident
- Copy of the incident report I filled out
- Security camera footage (USB drive - shows the actual slip and fall)
- The customer's contact information and initial medical report from EMTs

The customer was very nice about it and wasn't threatening litigation or anything, but she was clearly injured. Her husband arrived at the hospital and I spoke with him briefly. They seem like reasonable people but obviously they're concerned about medical bills.

Our restaurant has been operating for 8 years with no previous incidents like this. We have our floors cleaned every 2 hours and have "Wet Floor" signs, but apparently a server had just mopped near the kitchen and may not have put the sign up immediately.

I'm very concerned about this and want to make sure we handle it properly. The customer was wearing regular walking shoes (not heels) and the lighting in that area is good, so it really seems like our fault for having water on the floor.

Please let me know what steps I should take next and when an adjuster can come out to assess the situation.
