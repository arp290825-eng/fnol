Dear Claims Department,

I'm writing to report significant water damage to my home that occurred last night during the severe thunderstorm. My policy number is HO456789234.

What happened:
Around 11:30 PM last night, a large tree branch fell on my roof during the storm, creating a hole that allowed substantial water intrusion into my house. The damage is primarily in the master bedroom, hallway, and living room below.

Current situation:
- Active roof leak (temporarily tarped by emergency service)
- Soaked carpeting throughout second floor hallway and master bedroom
- Water stains on living room ceiling with active dripping
- Damaged drywall in multiple rooms
- Several pieces of furniture and personal belongings affected

I've attached:
1. Photos of the roof damage and interior water damage
2. Emergency roof repair invoice from ABC Roofing ($850 for temporary tarp)
3. Water extraction estimate from DryFast Services

My contact information:
- Phone: (555) 987-6543
- Email: robert.chen@email.com
- Property address: 456 Elm Street, Springfield, IL 62704

I had DryFast Services come out this morning for emergency water extraction. They estimate $3,200 for complete water removal and drying. The roof repair company (ABC Roofing) estimates $8,500 for permanent roof repair and interior restoration.

The storm was definitely covered under my policy - it was the same system that caused the tornado warning in our area last night. Weather reports show winds up to 75 mph.

I need to know how quickly you can get an adjuster out here. The water damage is getting worse by the hour and I'm concerned about mold if we don't act fast.

Please call me as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Robert Chen
Homeowner
