Hi,

I need to report a car accident that happened this morning around 9:15 AM at the intersection of Oak Street and 5th Avenue. I was driving my 2019 Honda Civic (license plate XYZ-789) when another vehicle ran a red light and hit my passenger side.

The other driver was in a 2020 Ford F-150, blue color. Police responded and wrote up a report (case #2024-031534). I have some photos of the damage and the police report attached.

My car has significant damage to the passenger door and rear quarter panel. The other driver admitted fault at the scene. There were no injuries, thankfully.

My policy number is AC789456123. My contact info:
- Phone: (555) 123-4567  
- Email: sarah.johnson@email.com
- Address: 123 Maple Drive, Springfield, IL 62701

I've already gotten an estimate from Joe's Auto Body Shop for $4,850 in repairs. The car is currently at their lot waiting for approval.

Please let me know what other information you need.

Thanks,
Sarah Johnson
